When I hit "Run all" there was no error that stopped the commands from running, which is good. 

I think under "# data inspection" you have a type of vieq(SNP) instead of view(SNP)

Looking through your commands and the files that they created I think you did a great job!

You're increasing and decreasing files look good and have all of the requirements. For some reason I didn't think about saving them in a text file and only created them in the environment so that's good that you remembered that. 

All of your graphs look good, the only recommendation I'd have is adding titles to them so people know what they're looking at. You're density graph is really cool. I also noticed you don't have your own visualization of a feature in the dataset. 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
